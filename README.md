TOP project for displaying DOM manipulation skills.


This project helped me improve upon the DOM manipulation skills I had learned in the previous project ('Rock Paper Scissors').
This was the first project where I tried applying css layout selectors.
I learnt about how CSS layout can be done using CSS grid. 
I got a good understanding on how javascript can be used to create and remove DOM elements dynamically. Here Javascript was used to create grid blocks based on the selected size. Grid blocks get colored black when mouse pointer is moved to these blocks. They return to original color when clear button is pressed.
